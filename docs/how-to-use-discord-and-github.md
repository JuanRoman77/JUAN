# How To Use Discord and Github

## Todos

1. Update your profile on Discord, Github, Figma (and any other platform we use)
  - Usernames should be the same and include your first name
  - Profile pictures should be the same

## Notifications

### Discord
- On Discord there are many sections. Our goal is to be efficient and produce, so unfollow categories that slow down your value creation https://www.loom.com/share/e280368e3ff541ebbf34b241639142d8

> [!TIP]
> Use `cmd + k` to open the [Quick Switcher](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000070311-Quick-Switcher). This shows the last few channels you've visited + your draft messages

> [!TIP]
> Use `cmd + [` and `cmd + ]` to move backwards and forwards like in a web browser. You can see more of the hotkeys if you press `cmd + /`

### Github
- Check your notifications by clicking the [icon in the top right corner](https://i.imgur.com/mTVGKOr.png)
- If you don't see any notification in the list, go to Profile>Settings>Notifications>Automatically watch repositories ON, and enable [Notify me: on GitHub](https://i.imgur.com/c4AlV9M.png)
- To prevent an overload of notifications, customise what notifies you and add an [unwatch filter](https://imgur.com/a/91OntyT)
- Type `reason:` in the [search bar](https://i.imgur.com/M2FRZjP.png) to filter unread notifications by _assign_, _mention_, _review requested_, etc., or use the [side panel](https://i.imgur.com/Kk7uVBk.png)

## Principles

1. After you read something you're tagged in:
  - Reply if you disagree
  - Reply if you have a question
  - Leave a checkmark if you've completed
  - Leave a thumbs up otherwise, to show your presence
2. Communication over text might be misunderstood
  - It doesn't mean someone hates you
  - It doesn't mean you're doing poorly
  - It's efficient
3. Our rules for replying is
  - Keep it under 12 hours for bottlenecks
  - Keep it under 24 hours for other stuff
4. Create threads rather than sending direct messages
  - Allows to tag other people into the conversation
  - Keeps an easily searchable record of the discussion, problem, solution, etc.

## Sharing Links
When sharing Github links, use the following format: `[PR or issue title](URL)`  
This gives the reader context without the need to open the raw link
