----

## 1. Dependability

### a. We are always active in communication channels.

1: Weekday replies <12h. Weekend <24h

## 2. Act like an Owner

### a. We take 120% responsibility for everything we do.  

-1: Completes tasks to 80% (Gets help from others to complete it)     
0: Completes tasks to 100%      
1: Completes tasks to 120% (Finds extra problems, fixes some, creates new tasks, and starts tackling the most important ones)

Example: Designer, after designing, checking the development process, checking the user sentiment after release, creating a report and learnings to share with team.

Example: Asking questions like `should I do X or Y` is a sign of -1 ownership. It means they haven't put in the thought. +1 ownership version of this would be `I looked in to all the data, read a few articles online and decided to go with X, here is my game plan, let me know if I'm missing anything, otherwise I'll start execution tomorrow.`

Example: `Here is my submission is it good? bad?` is a sign of -1 ownership. It means they are submitting a work. The job is more than the work. `Here is my work and here is my plan. I explored 4 options. I'll go with option X. Next, I will create issues, create dashboard for analytics, create reminder to check and give a weekly update on the success of the feature. Write learnings in 3 weeks and share with the team. I'll start executing tomorrow unless I'm told something missing.` is a sign of +1 ownership.

-1: Completes assigned tasks

Example: Jeff was working on backend game development, decided we needed better analytics, learned and setup Metabase which now became the default analytics tool of the company

Bad- Example: Doing their assigned job 80% and jumping around to help out other parts is -1 ownership and -1 efficient execution.
Example: Doing their assigned job 120% and tackling the [first degree problems](https://github.com/colonistio/katan/pull/14514/#discussion_r1438834582) is +1 ownership
